# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
## 160. 相交链表
>Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.  
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.    
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.  
>>Custom Judge:  
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):  
intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.  
listA - The first linked list.  
listB - The second linked list.  
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.  
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.  
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.  

已知两个链表的头部，返回两个链表的交叉节点。  
如果没有交叉则返回空。  
链表无环，且需要在函数结束的时候维持其原有的机构。

>Example 1:  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)  
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3  
Output: Intersected at '8'  
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).  
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.  
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.  

>Example 2:  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)  
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'  
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).  
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.  

Example 3:  
![](https://assets.leetcode-cn.com/aliyun-lc-upload/uploads/2018/12/14/160_example_3.png)  
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2  
Output: No intersection  
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.  
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.  
 

>Constraints:  
The number of nodes of listA is in the m.  
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.  
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4  
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5  
0 <= skipA < m  
0 <= skipB < n  
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.  
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.  

## 思考
可以利用哈希表来存储已经出现的节点地址，然后后续的时候进行判断，是否存在A或者B中已经出现的地址里面。如果是的话，则返回。  
但是在判断的时候，A、B长度不一致，同时循环的时候还需判断是否为空。  
```python3
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        tmpA=headA
        tmpB=headB
        dictA = {}
        dictB = {}
        ret = None
        while(tmpA or tmpB):
            if tmpA:
                dictA[tmpA] = tmpA.val
                if tmpA in dictB:
                    ret = tmpA.val
            if tmpB:
                dictB[tmpB] = tmpB.val
                if tmpB in dictA:
                    ret = tmpB.val
        return ret
```
很显然的超时了。  
### 快慢指针
灵机一动，突然想起来，这种问题是不是可以将B的头尾链接起来，然后变成循环链表找循环节点。结束之后把头尾分开就可以了。  
先得找到尾节点，并记录下来，然后进行快慢指针。  
```python3

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        tmpA = headA
        tail = tmpA
        tmpB = headB            
        
        while(tail.next):
            tail = tail.next
        tail.next = tmpB
        
        fast = tmpA.next.next
        slow = tmpA.next
        
        ret = None
        while(fast != slow):            
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                 # or not fast.next.next
                tail.next = None
                return None
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            
        print(slow.val)
        print(fast.val)
        p = headA
        while (p != slow):
            p = p.next
            slow = slow.next
        tail.next = None
        return p
            
```
## 答案
### 哈希集合
哈希链表判断比较简单就不继续进行描述了。  
### 双指针
指针走完A的路线，会到B的头部。指针走完B，回到A的头部。  
这一题是将A、B两个链表都遍历一遍，如果相交的话，最后会汇合在交点。指针各走了m+n步。   
如果没有交点，两个指针会同时走完A或者B指向None。  
```python3 
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        pa, pb = headA, headB
        while(pa != pb):
            if not pa:
                pa = headB
            else:
                pa = pa.next
            
            if not pb:
                pb = headA
            else:
                pb = pb.next
        return pa
            
```
## 总结
快慢指针的快为next.next 慢为next开始。
